    "description": "This characteristic is used to represent a unique identification assigned to a medical device and the controlling and assigning bodies.\nA Unique Device Identifier (UDI) is a string that is used to label a medical product in a pre-defined way as defined by a regional authority such as the US FDA. A UDI is linked to a registration of product information in a database and tracks a device in case of medical issues linked to using the device. A UDI consists of a Device Information (DI) part that identifies the device type and a Production Information (PI) part that identifies a specific device instance by the device\u2019s production date, serial number, and similar attributes. The UDI for Medical Devices characteristic contains the full UDI or at least the DI part (see \\RefRef{UDI_system} for more information).\nThe UDI Issuer and the UDI Authority fields contain international Object Identifiers (OIDs) as defined by ITU-T \\RefRef{OIDS_ITUT_X600} and ISO/IEC \\RefRef{OIDS_ISOIEC_9341}. For example, the OID for the US FDA is 2.16.840.1.113883.3.24. Details on an OID are retrievable via directories such as \\url{http://www.oid-info.com/}.\nThe structure of this characteristic is defined below.",
