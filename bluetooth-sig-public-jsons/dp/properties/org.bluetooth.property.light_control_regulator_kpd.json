    "description": "This property represents the proportional coefficient K_p in a decreasing output operation mode of a proportional-integral light controller. This represents the proportional coefficient when the light is decreasing its light output \u2014 indicated by the third character, d (\u201cdown\u201d), in Kpd, as opposed to the coefficient used when the light output is increasing, indicated by the third character, u (\u201cup\u201d), in Kpu."
