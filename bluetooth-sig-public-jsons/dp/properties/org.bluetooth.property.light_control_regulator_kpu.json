    "description": "This property represents the proportional coefficient K_p in an increasing output operation mode of a proportional-integral light controller. This represents the proportional coefficient when the light is increasing its light output \u2014 indicated by the third character, u (\u201cup\u201d), in Kpu, as opposed to the coefficient used when the light output is decreasing, indicated by the third character, d (\u201cdown\u201d), in Kpd."
