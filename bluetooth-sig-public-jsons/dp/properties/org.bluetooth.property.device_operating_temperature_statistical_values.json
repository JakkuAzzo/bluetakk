    "description": "This property represents the average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum operating temperatures and the data recording period as recorded by a temperature sensor. A value of 0 for the data recording period indicates that the period is the lifetime of the sensor.\nExample use case: These lifetime values for the operating temperature of an LED fixture can be used to predict the remaining lifetime of the fixture, which is strongly dependent on the operating temperature."
