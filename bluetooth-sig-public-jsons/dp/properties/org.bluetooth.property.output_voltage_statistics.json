    "description": "This property represents a set of statistical values for the output voltage of a device. It consists of five fields. The Average Voltage Value field represents the average voltage of a series of measured voltage values over a period of time. The Standard Deviation Voltage Value field represents the standard deviation of a series of measured voltage values over a period of time. The Minimum Electric voltage Value field represents the minimum of a series of measured voltage values over a period of time. The Maximum Electric voltage Value represents the maximum of a series of measured voltage values over a period of time. The Sensing Duration field represents the total data-recording period."
