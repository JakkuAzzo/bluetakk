    "description": "This property represents the ratio of the value reported by the sensor to the raw value measured by the sensor.\nExample use case: To calibrate reported values using a multiplier acting as an attenuator or amplifier. A negative Sensor Gain value is used when the sensor reports values in reverse to the measured values."
