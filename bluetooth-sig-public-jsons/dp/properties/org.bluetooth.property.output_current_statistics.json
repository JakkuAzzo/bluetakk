    "description": "This property represents a set of statistical values for the output current of a device. It consists of five fields. The Average Electric Current Value field represents the average current of a series of measured current values over a period of time. The Standard Deviation Electric Current Value field represents the standard deviation of a series of measured current values over a period of time. The Minimum Electric Current Value field represents the minimum of a series of measured current values over a period of time. The Maximum Electric Current Value field represents the maximum of a series of measured current values over a period of time. The Sensing Duration field represents the total data-recording period."
