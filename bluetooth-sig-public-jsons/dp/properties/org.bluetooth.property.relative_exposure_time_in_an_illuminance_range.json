    "description": "This property represents a relative exposure time of a light sensor (typically a photodetector) in an illuminance range.\nThe Relative Value field is the relative exposure time, that is, the exposure time within the illuminance interval compared with the total exposure time recorded by the sensor. See the Total Light Exposure Time property in \\autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.property.total_light_exposure_time}.\nThe Minimum Illuminance and Maximum Illuminance define the illuminance range.\nExample use case: To adjust light levels or reduce the hours of display for a particular piece of art in a museum.",
