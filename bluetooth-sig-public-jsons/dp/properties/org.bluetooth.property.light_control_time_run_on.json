    "description": "This property represents the duration of the run state after last occupancy was detected.\nExample use case: To prevent lights from entering a standby state when people are still in a room and occupancy detectors fail to detect occupancy (which could occur, for example, with passive infrared motion sensors and people in the room not moving for a period of time)."
