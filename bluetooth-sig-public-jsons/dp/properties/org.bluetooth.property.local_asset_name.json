    "description": "This property represents a localized asset name used to distinguish the device from other devices at its location. If the Spatial Unit Name property (see Section 3.x.y) is also supported and has a non-zero length, the Asset Local Name property provides local context within the corresponding spatial unit. The zero-length empty UTF-8 string \"\" indicates the value is unknown or invalid.\nExample use case: The string \"left-side bed\" identifies the left-side bed light within a main bedroom. The string \"W054\" represents a wheelchair asset (with a zero-length Spatial Unit Name property) at an airport."
