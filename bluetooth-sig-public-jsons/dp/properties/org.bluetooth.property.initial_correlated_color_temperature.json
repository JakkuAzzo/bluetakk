    "characteristic": "org.bluetooth.characteristic.correlated_color_temperature",
    "description": "This property represents the initial correlated color temperature associated with a device such as a color-tunable light. The value typically is measured by a spectrometer or a chroma meter, but can also be reported by a device that is aware of its chromaticity values, either by measurement or as a result of an association of its operating parameters with a color model. This property typically is configured by the manufacturer of the device."
