    "description": "This property represents the activity level, as, for example, detected by a motion sensor. Typically, this is detected by a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor. The motion activity is represented by a relative value ranging from 0 percent to 100 percent, with 100 percent the maximum activity that the sensor can record."
