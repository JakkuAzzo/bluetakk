    "description": "This property represents the minimum ambient illuminance level as measured by a lux sensor that determines if a light or a group of lights transitions from the standby state to a run state. The standby state is a state when the light is switched on and controlled, but operating at minimum level. This minimum level can be zero but can also be set to a low value for security or safety reasons. The run state is a state in which the light is switched on and operating at normal light level.\nThis property can be used to avoid lights being on during the day with ample daylight in a space."
