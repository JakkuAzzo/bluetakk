    "description": "This property represents the chromaticity coordinates x and y of a device using CIE 1931 \\RefRef{cie1931} Cx and Cy chromaticity coordinates. The value typically is measured by a spectrometer or a chroma meter, but it can also be reported by a device that is aware of its chromaticity values, either by measurement or as a result of an association of its operating parameters with a color model."
