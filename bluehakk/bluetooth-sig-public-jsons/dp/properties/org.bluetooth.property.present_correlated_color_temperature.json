    "characteristic": "org.bluetooth.characteristic.correlated_color_temperature",
    "description": "This property represents the present correlated color temperature associated with a device such as a color tunable light. The value typically is measured by a spectrometer or a chroma meter, but it can also be reported by a device that is aware of its chromaticity values, either by measurement, or as a result of an association of its operating parameters with a color model."
