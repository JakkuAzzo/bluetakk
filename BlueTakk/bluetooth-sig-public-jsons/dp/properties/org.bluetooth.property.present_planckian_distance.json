    "description": "This property represents the present distance of a chromaticity coordinate from the Planckian locus on the (u\u2019, 2/3v\u2019) diagram as defined by ANSI standard C78.377-2008 \\RefRef{ansi_c78}. The value typically is measured by a spectrometer or a chroma meter, but also can be reported by a device that is aware of its chromaticity values, either by measurement, or as a result of an association of its operating parameters with a color model."
