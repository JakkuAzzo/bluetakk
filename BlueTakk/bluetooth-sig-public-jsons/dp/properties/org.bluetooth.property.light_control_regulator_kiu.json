    "description": "This property represents the integral coefficient K_i in an increasing output operation mode of a proportional-integral light controller. This represents the integral coefficient when the light is increasing its light output \u2014 indicated by the third character, u (\u201cup\u201d), in Kiu, as opposed to the coefficient used when the light output is decreasing, indicated by the third character, d (\u201cdown\u201d), in Kid."
