    "description": "This property represents the over output ripple voltage event statistics and is composed of four values. The Number of Events field represents the count of over output ripple voltage events. The Average Event Duration field represents the average duration of all the over output ripple voltage events in the data recording period. The Time Elapsed Since Last Event field represents the time elapsed since the last over output ripple voltage event occurred. The Sensing Duration field represents the total data-recording period."
