    "characteristic": "org.bluetooth.characteristic.chromatic_distance_from_planckian",
    "description": "This property represents the distance of a chromaticity coordinate from the Planckian locus on the (u\u2019, 2/3v\u2019) diagram as defined by ANSI standard C78.377-2008 \\RefRef{ansi_c78} at first use of the device. The value typically is measured by a spectrometer or a chroma meter, but can also be reported by a device that is aware of its chromaticity values, either by measurement, or as a result of an association of its operating parameters with a color model. This property is typically configured by the manufacturer of the device."
