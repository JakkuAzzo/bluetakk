    "description": "This property represents the integral coefficient K_i in a decreasing output operation mode of a proportional-integral light controller. This represents the integral coefficient when the light is decreasing its light output \u2014 indicated by the third character, d (\u201cdown\u201d), in Kid, as opposed to the coefficient used when the light output is increasing, indicated by the third character, u (\u201cup\u201d), in Kiu."
