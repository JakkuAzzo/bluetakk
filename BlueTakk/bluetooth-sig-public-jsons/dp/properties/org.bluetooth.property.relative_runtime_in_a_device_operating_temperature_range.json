    "description": "This property represents a relative runtime of a device within an operating temperature range. The Relative Value is the relative runtime, that is, the runtime within the interval compared with the total runtime recorded by the device. See the Total Device Runtime property in \\autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.property.total_device_runtime}. The Minimum Temperature Value and Maximum Temperature Value define the operating temperature range.\nExample use case: To check whether the element has been operating within the specified operating temperature boundaries for warranty purposes, or to predict remaining life of the device.",
