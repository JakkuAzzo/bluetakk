    "description": "The System ID characteristic is used to represent an extended unique identifier (EUI) of the system implementing the service that contains this characteristic.\nThis 64-bit structure is an EUI-64 which consists of an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) concatenated with a manufacturer-defined identifier. The OUI is issued by the IEEE Registration Authority (RA) \\RefRef{ieee_registration} and should be used in accordance with the guidelines in \\RefRef{ieee_tutorial}. Supported lengths for IEEE-issued OUIs include 24 and 36 bits. In those cases, the remaining least significant 40 or 28 bits are manufacturer assigned.\nA Bluetooth Device Address is an EUI-48, is 48 bits in length, and can be based on an OUI as well, but this is not required. See Core Spec, volume 2, part B, section 1.2. Historically an EUI-48 could be mapped to an EUI-64 by inserting either the value 0xFFFE or the value 0xFF-FF in the middle of the 6-octet EUI-48. This mapping is deprecated.\nNote that the order of transmission of the EUI-64 octets in a Characteristic is LSO-MSO and also the bit order is little endian. In the System ID characteristic the uint64 starts with the manufacturer-defined identifier, whereas the representation of an EUI-64 in the IEEE-RA guidelines is MSO-LSO, starts with the OUI, and uses the big endian bit order.\nThe structure of this characteristic is defined below.",
