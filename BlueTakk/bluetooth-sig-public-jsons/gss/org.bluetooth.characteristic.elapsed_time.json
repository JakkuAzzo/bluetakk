The Time Value allows easy calculation of time differences and easy comparison of times. The characteristic is a fixed-size structure that provides sufficient information to interpret the reported time in many contexts.\n\\newpage\nThe flags determine if the Time Value represents a tick counter, UTC time or local time. The following formula gives the relation between local time and UTC time{{:}}\n\\hspace{1cm} \\textit{Local time} = \\textit{UTC time} + \\textit{TZ/DST Offset} * \\textit{15 minutes}\nThe structure of this characteristic is defined below.",
